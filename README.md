# 🌟 West Bengal Electoral Rolls 2025 Downloader

This project automates the process of fetching and downloading the **West Bengal Electoral Rolls 2025** at the booth level. It consists of two main scripts:

1. **`fetch_booth_urls.py`** – Scrapes all assembly constituencies and booth URLs from the CEO West Bengal website and stores them in an Excel file (`all_booths_urls.xlsx`).  
2. **`download_booth_pdfs.py`** – Downloads all booth PDFs using the URLs from the Excel file and organizes them in folders by assembly constituency.
